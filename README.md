# HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS

Just like every other business, hotel businesses also heavily benefit from the customer behavior data. The hotels can understand different factors to optimize their booking numbers and increase their business numbers. These factors can decide what their selling point can be to attract more number of guests or how to cater a variety of different customers or what improvements their facilities need to make in order to increase customer attraction.

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
